# Managing My Wardrobe and Favorite Car
 I started by creating an empty array named clothes. I added five of my favorite clothing items as strings using the push() method. Later, I decided to part ways with the fifth piece, so I used the pop() method to remove it. However, my wardrobe wasn't complete without a new addition, so I used push() again to add a fresh piece.

To check out my style, I used console.log to showcase the third item from the clothes array.

Shifting gears, I also created a new empty object named favCar. Using the dot notation, I assigned a color property to it, flaunting my chosen color. Next, I added a convertible property, reflecting whether my dream car has that convertible charm.

Curious about the details of my dream ride? Just check the console log of the entire favCar object to unveil the specifications.

Feel free to explore the code and witness my fashion sense and dream car preferences!
